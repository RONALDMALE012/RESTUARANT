            <p>Restaurant Policies and Rules.<br>
                Weâ€™ve developed these policies and rules at JACK IN THE BOX to create a good working environment for employees and
                an enjoyable dining experience for our guests. <br>Therefore, you are responsible for closely observing these policies and
                rules. <br>Although the employment relationship is one which may be terminated by you or the company, with or without cause
                at any time, the following are some of the actions which are violations of restaurant policies and rules, and which also may
                result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
                Restaurant Employee Hamburger Safety Commitment
                I will not handle raw hamburger patties with my bare hands. I will verify cooked patty doneness by visual check of each
                patty. I am aware that a fully cooked patty must reach a minimum internal temperature of 155 degrees.<br>

                Your attendance is extremely important to the success of the Company. We expect employees to strive for
                perfect attendance and to arrive for work on time. <br>We recognize that, on occasion, you may not be able to come
                to work or need additional time before you arrive. Sickness and other emergencies cannot always be anticipated
                and may require you to miss all or part of your work day.<br>
                If you cannot report to work as scheduled, you must notify your manager as soon as possible. If your need for
                time off is foreseeable, you must provide as much notice as possible. If your need for time off is not foreseeable,
                you must provide as much notice as practicable, but in no event less than four (4) hours prior to your normally
                scheduled starting time. Of course, if you cannot contact [e.g., your supervisor] yourself, you must have
                someone do it for you.<br>
                When you contact your immediate supervisor you must let them know for how long you will be out and when
                you expect to return or, as the case may be, arrive for work.<br>
                You must submit documentation for absences due to illness of three (3) days or more. Generally, you must
                provide a document from your doctor or other recognized health care provider that would justify your absence.
                Likewise, you will need to provide documentation justifying your return to work.<br>
                Excessive absences, or lateness and excessive patterns of absences or lateness may lead to disciplinary action,
                up to and including termination.<br>
                If you are absent from work for two (2) consecutive days without notice, the company will consider that you
                have voluntarily resigned your position.<br>
                1. Failure to report to work on a scheduled day or time without proper notice.<br>
                2. Walking off the job or leaving assigned work position or tasks without proper cause and prior permission.<br>
                3. Conducting personal business without authorization during work hours, including use of phone for personal
                reasons except in an emergency.<br>
                4. Taking breaks other than at assigned times or without permission of shift supervisor.<br>
                5. Failure to record all time worked on the timekeeping system.<br>
