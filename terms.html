            <p>The term (“Term”) of this Agreement shall be twelve calendar months commencing on the Start Date. Either party can terminate this Agreement by providing 30 calendar days’ written notice (Restaurant may terminate select locations by giving GiftAMeal 30 calendar days’ specific written notice), in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 of this Agreement.  If at the end of the Term, neither party has provided notice of termination, then the Term will be automatically renewed for another twelve calendar months under the same terms of the previous contract (“Renewal Term”).</p>
            <p> Restaurant shall pay the amounts set forth in GiftAMeal's then current fee list (“Fees”), as seen on the GiftAMeal Restaurant Sign Up Form (which is incorporated herein by this reference), without setoff, deduction, withholding or allowances. The Fees are subject to change from time to time in GiftAMeal’s sole discretion. GiftAMeal will notify Restaurant of changes to its applicable fee list, and such changes will become effective 30 days following such notice. Restaurant shall make all payments of Fees in accordance with Section 5 of this Agreement. Restaurant shall make all payments in US dollars by: (i) check mailed to the address specified for notice to GiftAMeal in Section 9, (ii) wire or electronic funds transfer to an account designated in writing from time to time by GiftAMeal, or (iii) pre-authorized ACH or credit card charges as specified in Exhibit A.  Regardless of form of payment, Restaurant shall make all payments of Fees within 30 calendar days after receipt of GiftAMeal’s invoice.                
                5.2    All Fees and other amounts payable by Restaurant under this Agreement are exclusive of taxes and similar assessments. Restaurant is responsible for all sales, use and excise taxes, and any other similar taxes, duties and charges of any kind imposed by any federal, state or local governmental or regulatory authority on any amounts payable by Restaurant hereunder, other than any taxes imposed on GiftAMeal's income. If GiftAMeal has the legal obligation to pay or collect taxes for which Restaurant is responsible under this Agreement, the appropriate amount shall be invoiced to and paid by Restaurant, unless Restaurant gives GiftAMeal a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.</p>
                <p>If any payment remains outstanding more than 30 days after the applicable due date, then, in addition to all other remedies available to GiftAMeal: (a) GiftAMeal may charge interest on the past due amount from the date due until the date paid, at the rate of one percent (1%) per month, or the highest rate permitted under applicable law, calculated daily and compounded monthly, whichever is lower;  (b) Restaurant shall reimburse GiftAMeal for all reasonable costs incurred by GiftAMeal in collecting any late payments or interest, including attorneys' fees, court costs and collection agency fees; and (c) GiftAMeal may disable, withhold, suspend or revoke Services until all past due amounts, interest, fees and costs have been paid, without incurring any obligation or liability to Restaurant or any other person by reason of any such action.
