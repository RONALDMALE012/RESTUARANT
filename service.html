            <p>1. Greet the customer with a smile
                Example: As a family of four walks into the restaurant, the hostess smiles and welcomes them. She then asks the family if they prefer a booth or a table. The father, Chris, says they would like a table, and the hostess says she has one ready for them. As she walks the family to their table, she asks them if they're dining out for a special occasion, and the mom, Janet, replies that it's her husband's birthday. The hostess wishes the husband a happy birthday and offers the family a discounted appetizer with their meals before seating them.
                Explanation: As soon as a customer walks into the restaurant, their customer experience begins. Try to greet customers enthusiastically as soon as they enter the building. As you walk them to their table, you can ask them questions like if they've had a good day or if there's any special reason they're dining out. Many customers appreciate this friendliness as you seat them at their table. Small gestures like these show customers that the staff cares about providing a positive dining experience.<br>5. Check on your customers often
                Example: After taking the family's order, Allen goes back to check on them once more before bringing them their order. He asks if anyone needs anything, and they say they're doing great. He tells them he's going to check on their order and that it should be out soon. Before he leaves the table, he sees that Chris's drink is almost empty, so he brings a refill when he brings out their order of food. He asks if they would like any extra condiments or utensils, and they say everything looks great and they're all right for now.
                Explanation: Good customer service includes attending to customers frequently. Try to check on your customers regularly and ask if they need any drink refills, extra utensils or condiments and make them aware of the status of their orders. Let them know you're doing your best to make this an exceptional dining experience for them.<br>9. Ask for customer feedback
                Example: After Allen delivers the check, he asks Chris and Janet if they would be interested in filling out a quick comment card or customer survey on their phones before they leave. He tells them he appreciates their feedback and that it helps to improve customer service for the next time they come in for a meal. He thanks them for dining at the restaurant, wishes Chris a happy birthday again and tells them to have a great rest of their evening.
                Explanation: Consider asking customers to fill out comment cards or complete a customer survey before they leave. This shows that you're interested in their feedback regarding your service and that you care about what you did well and how you can improve. Using comment cards allows you to understand the quality of your service from the perspective of the customer, which can be a great way to discover ideas for how to improve in the future.</p>
